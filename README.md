<h2>Analyzing Traffic Accident Patterns</h2>

This project focuses on analyzing synthetic data to simulate traffic accident patterns based on road conditions, weather, time of day, and accident hotspots using Python and data visualization libraries.

<h3>Purpose</h3>
The purpose of this project is to simulate and analyze traffic accident data to:

<ul>
  <li>Explore distributions of road conditions, weather conditions, and time of day.</li>
<li>Identify accident hotspots using clustering techniques.</li>
<li>Analyze factors influencing accident severity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Synthetic Data Generation</h3>
The synthetic data is generated to simulate various aspects of traffic accidents:
<ul>
<li>Road Conditions: Simulated as 'Dry', 'Wet', or 'Icy'.</li>
<li>Weather Conditions: Simulated as 'Clear', 'Rainy', or 'Snowy'.</li>
<li>Time of Day: Simulated as hours ranging from 0 to 23.</li>
<li>Accident Locations: Simulated using latitude and longitude coordinates within a specific region.</li>
<li>Accident Severity: Simulated as random integers from 1 to 5.</li>
</ul>
